## Compare Test Tool
This is the simple test tool aimed to test programs producing file outputs. If one need to implement some text file comparison-based tests, the **ctt** helps to organize it.

### Usage
```
python ctt.py config.xml
```
where config.xml describes which program to run, the files are generated and the files expected.
